###Lords of Hellas is a fantastic game, and I highly suggest using this make in combination with other box organizers made by folks like peloquin17.

The one challenge I found is: I sleeve all my cards, and Awaken Realms doesn't account for this with their tray structure. However, if you turn the majority of the cards vertically, instead of laying them horizontally, we can fit everything in the base box (when combined with some other organizers like I mentioned above.

The layout is straightforward:

1. Sleeve the standard-sized cards and place in right hand compartment vertically
2. Place 13 (that's my number, perhaps yours differs) sleeved standard-sized cards on the left side, horizontally
3. Put your figurines in the figurine container and place over the cards in the left side
4. Sleeve your mini-cards and evenly distribute across the flat top container
5. Put the lid on the top container and it should rest across both the vertical cards and the figure container

This is my first design and make, so I'm very happy to share it with everyone. I hope it works for others as well.
